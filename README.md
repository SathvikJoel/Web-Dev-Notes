# Web-Dev-Notes
I am Finally learning WebDev !

> For some reason I always felt that as a Computer Science student, I should acquire the basic knowledge about Web Dev in general. This Repo is a stepping stone in that direction. For all the cool stuff that I am yet to build with this amazing technology this repo will serve as a place to store my notes that I can refer back after ages and get on with my life. For the future me, thank me later !!
